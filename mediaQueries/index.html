        <h1>Combining media queries</h1>
        <p>
          You can use lots of different CSS units in your media queries. If your
          content is mostly image-based, pixels might make the most sense. If
          your content is mostly text-based, it probably makes more sense to use
          a unit that’s based on text size, like `rem` or `em`
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also combine media queries to apply more than one condition.
          Use the word `and` to combine your media queries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this example, the background color will change but only when the
          viewport width is between <code>50em</code> and <code>60em</code>.

            Those who may desire to study the principles of the Jacquard-loom in
            the most effectual manner, viz. that of practical observation, have
            only to step into the Adelaide Gallery or the Polytechnic
            Institution. In each of these valuable repositories of scientific
            illustration, a weaver is constantly working at a Jacquard-loom, and
            is ready to give any information that may be desired as to the
            construction and modes of acting of his apparatus. The volume on the
            manufacture of silk, in Lardner's Cyclopædia, contains a chapter on
            the Jacquard-loom, which may also be consulted with advantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mode of application of the cards, as hitherto used in the art of
            weaving, was not found, however, to be sufficiently powerful for all
            the simplifications which it was desirable to attain in such varied
            and complicated processes as those required in order to fulfil the
            purposes of an Analytical Engine. A method was devised of what was
            technically designated backing the cards in certain groups according
            to certain laws. The object of this extension is to secure the
            possibility of bringing any particular card or set of cards into use
            any number of times successively in the solution of one problem.
            Whether this power shall be taken advantage of or not, in each
            particular instance, will depend on the nature of the operations
            which the problem under consideration may require. The process is
            alluded to by M. Menabrea, and it is a very important
            simplification. It has been proposed to use it for the reciprocal
            benefit of that art, which, while it has itself no apparent
            connexion with the domains of abstract science, has yet proved so
            valuable to the latter, in suggesting the principles which, in their
            new and singular field of application, seem likely to place
            algebraical combinations not less completely within the province of
            mechanism, than are all those varied intricacies of which
            intersecting threads are susceptible. By the introduction of the
            system of backing into the Jacquard-loom itself, patterns which
            should possess symmetry, and follow regular laws of any extent,
            might be woven by means of comparatively few cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who understand the mechanism of this loom will perceive that
            the above improvement is easily effected in practice, by causing the
            prism over which the train of pattern-cards is suspended to revolve
            backwards instead of forwards, at pleasure, under the requisite
            circumstances; until, by so doing, any particular card, or set of
            cards, that has done duty once, and passed on in the ordinary
            regular succession, is brought back to the position it occupied just
            before it was used the preceding time. The prism then resumes its
            forward rotation, and thus brings the card or set of cards in
            question into play a second time. This process may obviously be
            repeated any number of times.
