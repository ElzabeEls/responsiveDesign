          You can test for three possible values with the pointer media feature:
          none, coarse, and fine.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a browser reports a pointer value of none the user might be using a
          keyboard to interact with your website.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a browser reports a pointer value of coarse it means the primary
          input mechanism isn’t very accurate. A finger on a touchscreen is a
          coarse pointer.
        </li>

        <li>
          If a browser reports a pointer value of fine it means the primary
          input mechanism is capable of fine-grained control. A mouse or stylus
          is a fine pointer.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can adjust the size of your interface elements to suit the pointer
          value. Try visiting
          <a href="https://gui-challenges.web.app/settings/dist/"
            >this website</a
          >
          in different kinds of devices to see how the interface adapts.
        </li>
        <li>
          An any-pointer value of none means that no pointing device is
          available.
        </li>
        <li>
          if you use the keyboard to tab to something you are focusing not
          hovering.
        </li>
        <li>
          any-hover will be true if any of the available input mechanisms are
          capable of hovering over elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          the type value in html inputs helps to bring up the correct virtual
          keyboard
        </li>
        <li>
          inputmode is not supported by Safari so did not include key points
        </li>
        <li>autocomplete="email" in an input can improve user experience</li>
