              <p>
                Those who may desire to study the principles of the
                Jacquard-loom in the most effectual manner, viz. that of
                practical observation, have only to step into the Adelaide
                Gallery or the Polytechnic Institution. In each of these
                valuable repositories of scientific illustration, a weaver is
                constantly working at a Jacquard-loom, and is ready to give any
                information that may be desired as to the construction and modes
                of acting of his apparatus. The volume on the manufacture of
                silk, in Lardner's Cyclopædia, contains a chapter on the
                Jacquard-loom, which may also be consulted with advantage.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mode of application of the cards, as hitherto used in the
                art of weaving, was not found, however, to be sufficiently
                powerful for all the simplifications which it was desirable to
                attain in such varied and complicated processes as those
                required in order to fulfil the purposes of an Analytical
                Engine. A method was devised of what was technically designated
                backing the cards in certain groups according to certain laws.
                The object of this extension is to secure the possibility of
                bringing any particular card or set of cards into use any number
                of times successively in the solution of one problem. Whether
                this power shall be taken advantage of or not, in each
                particular instance, will depend on the nature of the operations
                which the problem under consideration may require. The process
                is alluded to by M. Menabrea, and it is a very important
                simplification. It has been proposed to use it for the
                reciprocal benefit of that art, which, while it has itself no
                apparent connexion with the domains of abstract science, has yet
                proved so valuable to the latter, in suggesting the principles
                which, in their new and singular field of application, seem
                likely to place algebraical combinations not less completely
                within the province of mechanism, than are all those varied
                intricacies of which intersecting threads are susceptible. By
                the introduction of the system of backing into the Jacquard-loom
                itself, patterns which should possess symmetry, and follow
                regular laws of any extent, might be woven by means of
                comparatively few cards.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those who understand the mechanism of this loom will perceive
                that the above improvement is easily effected in practice, by
                causing the prism over which the train of pattern-cards is
                suspended to revolve backwards instead of forwards, at pleasure,
                under the requisite circumstances; until, by so doing, any
                particular card, or set of cards, that has done duty once, and
                passed on in the ordinary regular succession, is brought back to
                the position it occupied just before it was used the preceding
                time. The prism then resumes its forward rotation, and thus
                brings the card or set of cards in question into play a second
                time. This process may obviously be repeated any number of
                times.

            <h2>Scaling Text</h2>
            <h3>
              responsive approach is to let the user's device width influence
              the text size.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              It's important that you don't use the vw by itself in a font-size
              declaration. If you do, the user won't be able to resize the text.
              The text will be resizable if you mix in a relative unit—like em,
              rem or ch. The CSS calc() function is perfect for this. But now
              there's a possibility that the text will get too small on narrow
              screens and too big on wide screens.

          a more responsive option is using viewport width: font-size:

          able to resize the text.

        <li>
          clamping text size keeps text within a size range: font-size:
          clamp(1rem, 0.75rem + 1.5vw, 2rem);
        </li>
        <li>
          can use max-inline-size to limit how wide a container can be. Prevents
          text from getting too wide. - use a relative unit: max-inline-size:
          700px;
        </li>
        <li>Shorter lines of text can have larger line-height values.</li>
        <li>
          Use unitless values for your line-height declarations. This ensures
          that the line height is relative to the font-size: line-height: 1.5;

          If you're using lots of different weights, a variable font could give
          you a big performance gain.
