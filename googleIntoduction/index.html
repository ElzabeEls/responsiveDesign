      <h2>Step 1: Meta Tag (to prevent scaling)</h2>
      <p>
        `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />`
        There are two values, separated by commas. The first one is
        width=device-width. This tells the browser to assume the width of the
        website is the same as the width of the device (instead of assuming the
        width of the website is 980 pixels). The second value is
        initial-scale=1. This tells the browser how much or how little scaling
        to do. With a responsive design, you don't want the browser to do any
        scaling at all.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Use meta tag to prevent everything from scaling to a very small size
        </li>
        <li>
          value 1 in tag: width=device-width - tells browser website width is
          same as device width
        </li>
        <li>
          value 2 in tag: initial-scale=1 - tells browser how much to scale
        </li>
